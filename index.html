            Heritage open days are a brilliant way to reignite your urge to 
            explore your own city. Investigating buildings that are usually 
            off limits and hearing history that you’ve heard a thousand times 
            before from a new perspective can remind you why you fell in love 
            with it in the first place. Having been off sunning myself for most 
            of the events, I was determined to make the most of the Sunday I 
            had remaining before I got caught up in the drudgery of the nine to 
            five again.'

            We start in the Portico Library, the entrance to which is tucked 
            down the side of a pub, with tempting smells drifting over from 
            China Town. Resisting the urge to skip off for some spring onion 
            pancakes, we ring the bell and wait. After the ominous buzz 
            granting us entry and the climb up the staircase (there may have 
            been a rest stop or two involved) we surface into a beautifully 
            bright room, filled to the ceiling with books. If you’ve ever 
            asked me what my goal in life is, you will know that high up the 
            list is having a towering library in my house with a ladder that 
            swings around it. This comes pretty close to that dream. The 
            shelves are stacked high with ‘Polite Literature’ and there are 
            cosy reading nooks nestled in the corners, which beg you to come 
            and curl up and stay there for hours, immersed in another world. 
            Sadly, it’s missing some of the indefinable magic it should hold, 
            and I think it must be due to the lack of the ever-reassuring 
            smell of old books. I’ll have to keep looking for my library 
            inspiration.

            With that in mind, the next item on the itinerary is Chetham’s 
            Library. Ah. Closed. This puts a bit of a hitch in our plans 
            because we are not sensible enough to arrange back-ups and our 
            next stop isn’t until much later. After looking at each other 
            blinking and nonplussed for a few minutes, we decide to while 
            away some time with a few gin and tonics in The Gas Lamp to 
            bolster our moods. Housed in a cellar of the Victorian children’s 
            mission, this bar is one of my favourite in Manchester. The 
            tiled walls are sparsely decorated, and provided it’s not a 
            Friday or Saturday night, it’s usually quiet. Being able to 
            get a seat and not having to scream myself hoarse are two of 
            my prerequisites for a good drinking den.

            Re-fueled, we head up to the Crown and Kettle. It’s the sort of 
            pub in which the city centre is sadly lacking; relaxed, cosy, 
            with a good selection and an adorable dog ambling around looking 
            for attention. This is the starting point of a walking tour 
            around old pubs and mills in Ancoats, hosted by the North 
            Manchester branch of CAMRA.

              The Portico Library is members only, but the gallery is open to 
              the public most of the time. Best to check their 
              <a href="http://www.theportico.org.uk/visit-us">website</a> 
              and maybe call ahead if you are planning to visit.
          </p>

              Chetham’s Library is 
              <a href="http://library.chethams.com/about/visiting/">open</a> 
              to the public year round. Hopefully 
              your trip will be more successful than ours.
